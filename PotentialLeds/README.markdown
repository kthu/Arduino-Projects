This project uses 4 1k resistors, 4 leds and a 100k potentiometer. It is supposed to be easily expandable to more leds. 

Adjusting the potentiometer will light a number of leds depending on the value read from the potentiometer.  Turning the potentiometer more than halfway will cause all leds to blink.

This project contains a Makefile to make it useable with proper editors. The makefile depends on libyaml-perl. The Makefile assumes at least version 1.0 of the arduino IDE to be installed.

This was my first Arduino project.
